Machine Learning Algorithm implementation and model training using dataset
An end-to-end machine learning project involves collecting and preprocessing relevant data, selecting and training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics.
Once the model is trained, it can be deployed and integrated into a production environment to make predictions or automate decision-making.
Continuous monitoring and maintenance of the deployed model, including periodic retraining, is essential to ensure its accuracy and relevance over time.
                  In a machine learning project using a dataset and historical data, the first step is to carefully analyze and preprocess the dataset, ensuring it is clean, relevant, and properly formatted.
Historical data is then used to train and validate machine learning models, such as regression, classification, or time series models, to make predictions or extract insights.
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, and the model can be deployed to generate predictions or support decision-making based on new data.
